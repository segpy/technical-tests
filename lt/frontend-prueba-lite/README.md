Installation Guide for Angular
==============================

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up an Angular project and getting it up and running on your local development environment.

Prerequisites
-------------

-   Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
-   You should also have basic knowledge of Angular, TypeScript, and the command line.

Step 1: Install the Angular CLI
-------------------------------

The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that will help you create, manage, and build Angular projects. You can install it globally on your machine by running the following command:

javaCopy code

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

Step 2: Create a new project
----------------------------

Once the Angular CLI is installed, you can use it to create a new Angular project. Run the following command to create a new project named `my-project`:

javascriptCopy code

`ng new my-project`

The CLI will prompt you with a few questions about how you want to set up your project. You can accept the default options by just hitting Enter.

Step 3: Serve the application
-----------------------------

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory by running the following command:

bashCopy code

`cd my-project`

You can now use the Angular CLI to serve the application locally. Run the following command to start the development server:

Copy code

`ng serve`

The CLI will compile and serve the application, and it will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`. The development server will also watch for changes in the code and automatically reload the application when changes are detected.

Step 4: Build the application
-----------------------------

When you're ready to build your application for production, run the following command:

cssCopy code

`ng build --prod`

This will create a production-ready build of your application in the `dist/` directory.

Conclusion
----------

You have now successfully set up an Angular project and are ready to start building your application. Remember to always consult the [official Angular documentation](https://angular.io/docs) for more information and guidance.
